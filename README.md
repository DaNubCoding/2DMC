2DMC is an abbreviation for 2 Dimensional Minecraft. This idea is originally created and implemented by Griffpatch on Scratch. This is a personal project of creating a Paper Minecraft clone in python, better, smoother, and more Minecrafty.
The project is built entirely in pygame, using minecraft textures.
Development is still ongoing!
