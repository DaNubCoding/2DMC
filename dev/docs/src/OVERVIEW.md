# 2DMC Docs

This book serves as a documentation library for 2DMC's code and systems and a central hub for tutorials and guides relating to said systems.

These docs are under construction; all information hee was orignally stored in 1 long continuous file, so if there is anything that seems out of place or doesnt make sense, report it to us and wait until we have more thoroughly documented everything.

## Todo

- File strucure and root files
- Our modules
- Stuff in utils
- Styling conventions
- Anything else we deem useful
- Profiling + how to use it
- Inheritance trees (entities, particles, ect.)
- File formats (.structure, distribution.structure)
